# Beating the Stock Market

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve with an analysis of energy stocks, specifically "DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ). Steve's parents invested all their money into DQ. Steve is worried about his parents not diversifying, and how the stock has performed historically. To start this project Steve provided a spreadsheet of clean energy stocks to dig into. 

Key metrics Steve is looking for include:  
- Total Daily Volumne
- Return


## Results

Utilizing VBA within Excel to complete this project, I have created an easy and automated way to repeat this deliverable. 

Some of the techniques used were:
- Setting variables (e.g. ```Dim startTime As Single```)
- Adding values to cells (e.g. ```Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"```)
- Loading Arrays (e.g. ```tickers(0) = "AY"```)
- Looping through repetitive task with For Loops e.g.
        ``` For tickerIndex = 0 To 11
        ' Action
        Next tickerIndex```)

Looking at the performance of energy stocks between 2017 and 2018, we can tell 2017 was a much better year for energy stocks based on our sample size. DQ in particular, had a tough year in 2018. On the other hand, ENPH ticker looks like a great buy. Two great return years in a row. ENPH also has a higher total daily volume than any other stock in the sample size for 2018.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages of refactoring code include enhancement of code (shorter and quicker run times), bug fixing and maintainability. Some disadvantages of refactoring code include cost/time, introduction of bugs and close deadlines. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
These pros and cons apply to refactoring of the original VBA script in a couple of ways. The code was enhanced for shorter and quicker run time. It also introduced easier maintainability of the code as it is more intuitive when reading. The cons introduced include timeliness of refactoring the code. In this case it only took ~2 hours to refactor the code.
