# Beating the Stock Market

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve with an analysis of enery stocks, specifically "DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ). Steve's parent invested all there money into DQ and Steve is worried about them not diversifying, and how the stock has performed historically. To start this project Steve provided a spreadsheet of clean energy stocks to dig into.

I have used VBA within Excel to complete this project. With VBA, we have created an easily repeatable deliverable. 

Some of the techniques used were:
- Setting variables (e.g. ```Dim startTime As Single```)
- Adding values to cells (e.g. ```Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"```)
- Loading Arrays (e.g. ```tickers(0) = "AY"```)
- Looping through repetitive task with For Loops (e.g. ``` For tickerIndex = 0 To 11 ... Next tickerIndex```)
